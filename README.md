ADDITIONAL FEATURES I'D LOVE TO ADD IF I'M GIVEN ANOTHER CHANCE AND TIME INCLUDES:
1. Advanced Filtering and Sorting- which i'd implement more refined filtering options, like category filter, date range selection and sorting by name,date recent and more cool features
2. i'd integrate Redux Toolkit or React Query for better state management and caching of API responses.
3. i'd also love to add theme switcher to improve user experience
4. Authentication, Animation and Localstorage.
